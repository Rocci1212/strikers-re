ITEM RELATED STUFF

item IDs:
00 = Green Shell
01 = Red Shell
02 = Spikey Shell
03 = Ice Shell
04 = Banana
05 = Bomb-omb
06 = Chain Chomp
07 = Mushroom
08 = Star
09 = SP Mario
0A = SP Peach
0B = SP Donkey Kong
0C = SP Bowser
0D = SP Luigi
0E = SP Daisy
0F = SP Wario
10 = SP Waluigi
11 = SP Bowser Jr.
12 = SP Diddy Kong
13 = SP Yoshi
14 = SP Petey Piranha
FF = No item
these are really important to understand the part of the code that randomizes items 


8009ba58 - this instruction gives the player a chain chomp (ID = 6)
8009ba68 - this instruction gives the player a star (ID = 8)
8009ba94 - this instruction gives the player spiny shells (ID = 2)
8009baa4 - this instruction gives the player red shells (ID = 1)
8009bab4 - this instruction gives the player bombs (ID = 5)
8009bac4 - this instruction gives the player bananas (ID = 4)
8009bad4 - this instruction gives the player Mushrooms (ID = 7)
8009bae4 - this instruction gives the player green shells (ID = 0)
8009baf4 - this instruction gives the player ice shells (ID = 3)
8009ba20 - this instruction gives the player the default item (Mushroom) < If for some reason the game "doesn't know" what item to give to the player, it defaults to mushroom. (I don't think this has ever happened without mods)

^in that part of the code there are a lot of instruction that compare r3 with another register
cmpw r3, rX 
r3 contains a randomly generated value. 
the game gets the item chance values from somewhere in the memory (idk where yet) and puts them in a specific register we'll call rX

rX =
r30 for chomps
r29 for stars
r27 for specials
r26 for spiny shells
r25 for reds
r24 for bombs
r23 for nanas
r22 for shrooms
r21 for greens
r31 for freeze shells

8009ba60 is the line that checks if the Random generated number (which btw is stored in r3) low enough to get a star, if the RNG number is higher or equal, it means player won't get a star

the lines from 8009b8a8 to 8009b9e8 are used by the game when some item cheat is on, they set to zero the chances of the items you can't get if that cheat is on

MATCH STATUS STRUCT:
Address of this struct is at 0x806DF9D8
Offsets:
ITEM SLOTS (word):
0x8c - home item 1
0x90 - home item 1 quantity 
0x98 - home item 2
0x9c - home item 2 quantity
0xbf4 - away item 1 
0xbf8 - away item 1 quantity
0xc00 - away item 2 
0xc04 - away item 2 quantity
--------

800a6280 - instruction that gives home an item on the first slot
8009bcd4 - linked branch that leads to the function that gives you an item

------------------------------------------------------------
CHARACTER COLORS/RGB...


The higher a priority value is, the lower the priority is, so if you a character's priority to FF, they will change their color vs anyone with the same color (unless they're not the only character with FF)
If 2 characters have the same prio noone changes color


when i say "COLOR" i don't mean the actual RGB (Scroll down for that). With color i mean a value that the games checks to see if one of the selected characters needs to swap to alt color because it's too similar to the opponent's one. 
This is how it works: there's a byte, and each of the bits in that byte is a boolean value that states if the character is of a certain color, if the bit = 0 it means the character isn't of that color, if it's 1 the character is of that color. A character can have multiple colors (Diddy and daisy are both Red and Yellow).
The first three bits are unused, the other five bits are YELLOW, PURPLE, PINK, GREEN, RED. So if a character is green, the color byte is 00000010 (02 in Hex), if it's purple it's 00001000 (08 in hex), if it's both Red and yellow it's 00010001 (11 in hex). 
If 2 characters share at least a color in common, one of them (The one with the lower priority) has to change color. 


80504d03 Mario's color
80504d07 Mario's prio
80504d5f Bowser's color
80504d63 Bowser's prio

80504dbb Daisy's color
80504dbf Daisy's prio
80504e17 DK's color
80504e1b DK's prio

80504e73 Luigi's color
80504e77 Luigi's prio
80504ecf Peach's color
80504ed3 Peach's prio

80504f2b Walu's color
80504f2f Walu's prio
80504f87 Wario's color
80504f8a Wario's prio

80504fe3 Yoshi's color
80504fe7 Yoshi's prio
8050503f BJ's color
80505043 BJ's prio

8050509b Diddy's color
8050509f Diddy's prio
805050f7 Petey's color
805050fb Petey's prio


Examples of cheat codes to change priorities:
04504ed0 000000f0  <- code to set peach priority really low
04504dbf 000000f1  <- daisy prio even lower
0450509f 000000f2  <- diddy prio lowest

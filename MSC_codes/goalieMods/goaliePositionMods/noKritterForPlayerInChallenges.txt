CODE EXPLAINED:
28c5f33e 00000004		# Check if gamemode is Strikers challenges or ABC
48000000 8056A760		# po = [0x8056A760]
DE000000 80008180		# Check if po is between 0x80000000 and 0x81800000 (checks if the pointer to kritter's stats is loaded)
14000678 C1f00000		#  Write 0xc1f00000 at po + 0Ã—678. So let's say po is 0x81001200, now the code handler will look for the address 0x81001200 + 0x678, so 0x81001878 and write the word 0xC1f00000 there. 0xC1f00000 is the floating point value for -30
1400067C 41600000		# write 0x41600000 at po + 0x67c
E0000000 80008000		# Final terminator, resets the ba and the po

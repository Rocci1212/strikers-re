CODE EXPLAINED:
# This code locks both kritters at some coordinates outside of the field
48000000 8056a760		# po = [0x8056A760] (Set po to the value at 0x8056A760)
de000000 80008180		# Check if po is between 0x80000000 and 0x81800000 (checks if pointer to kritter's stats is loaded)
14000678 c1000000		# Write 0xc1000000 at po + 0Ã—678. So let's say po is 0x81001200, now the code handler will look for the address 0x81001200 + 0x678, so 0x81001878 and write the word 0xC1000000 there.
1400067c 41600000		# write 0x41600000 at po + 0x67c
e0000000 80008000		# Final terminator, resets the ba and the po
48000000 8056a764		# Beginning of the second part of the code: it's similar to the first part, except it's for Away kritter, so some values are different
